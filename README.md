# WordVectorAnalysis

In­Depth Word Vectors Analysis

### Objectives:

This assignment focuses on a comprehensive understanding of word vector technologies, specifically Word2Vec and GloVe. You will explore their applications, visualize the results, and analyze the semantic and syntactic relationships they capture.

1. Building and Analyzing Word Vectors with Word2Vec (20 Points)
   •Task: Create word vectors using the Word2Vec model on a selected corpus.
   •Visualization: Utilize PCA or t-SNE for visualizing these vectors in 2D.
   •Analysis: Discuss the word relationships and clusters formed.
2. GloVe Vectors Advanced Analysis (20 Points)
   •Task: Analyze word relationships using pre-trained GloVe vectors.
   •Activity: Conduct an analogy task (e.g., king - man + woman = ?) with examples.
   •Explanation: Explain the results of the analogy tasks.
3. Semantic and Syntactic Word Relationships (10 Points)
   •Comparison: Evaluate Word2Vec and GloVe for capturing semantic and syntactic
   relationships.
   •Illustration: Use specific word pairs or groups to demonstrate differences in repre-
   sentation by each model

### Resources for Word2Vec and GloVe:

- Word2Vec: Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings can be found on repositories such as
  HuggingFace or directly using Gensim.
- GloVe: Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are available at the GloVe website or through
  HuggingFace

### Submission Guidelines:

- Code Quality
- Analysis and Interpretation
- Visualization
- Adherence to the Assignment Objectives
